    "# Q1. What is Abstraction in OOP? Explain with an example.\n",
    "# Abstraction in OOP is the concept of hiding the complex implementation details of a system and exposing only the necessary parts to the user. It allows a user to interact with the system without understanding the underlying complexities. The main goal is to reduce complexity and increase efficiency.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "# Consider a car. When you drive a car, you use the steering wheel, pedals, and gear shift, but you don't need to know how the engine works, how fuel is injected into the engine, or how the car's transmission system operates. This is abstraction in actionâ€”the complex details are hidden, and only the necessary interfaces (steering wheel, pedals, etc.) are provided to the user.\n",
